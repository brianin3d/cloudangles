opengl 3d cloud fractal attempt in haxe

# Wuzzit?

Based loosely on my [2d cloud](https://code.google.com/p/brianin3d-bitly/source/browse/trunk/us/versus/them/bitly/Cloud.hx) code, trying to do something similar in 3d with openGl and blending.

Sort of works... The runme.sh will compile and run it.

You will probly need the opengl haxlib if it doesn't magic down.

Here is some stuff... dunno mark down well enuff to say if just putting this here will image it up..

Having some problems getting the opengl haxelib to work under 64-bit :-(

# Stuff

Welcome to the opengl Archetype!

To compile to swf: haxe compile.hxml
To run tests:      haxe test.hxml && neko Test

The demo App.hx is based on xinf.org's test/App.hx

Tests can be added to tests directory and incorporated into Test.hx
